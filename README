xmpp4moz is a library to ease creation of Firefox extensions and other
Mozilla applications that use the XMPP protocol (Extensible Messaging
and Presence Protocol), also known as Jabber.

It includes a slightly modified version of the pull parser from the
XML for <SCRIPT> suite (http://xmljs.sourceforge.net).

xmpp4moz is a library to ease creation of Firefox extensions and other
Mozilla applications that use the XMPP protocol (Extensible Messaging
and Presence Protocol), also known as Jabber.

It depends on ModuleManager, that you can get as part of MozLab
(http://dev.hyperstruct.net/mozlab) or separately
(http://repo.hyperstruct.net/mozlab/chrome/content/lib/module_manager.js).
